This project has been built using RESTApi from Edamam Recipes api to get the meals recipe using axios/fetch/async-await
I will be using ReactJS useEffect and useState to fetch and set the Data.
For styling for now i will be using plain CSS, later will move to styled-components
And also after wrapping up the project i will deploy it to Cloud Hosting Heroku.
